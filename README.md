# FYP
This is the serverside of my FYP for college - it enables users to upload their expenses directly from the Point of Sale (POS). It is built using a MERN stack and by leveraging 
exposed APIs from Xero. Due to time constraints I am emulating the POS, however with authorisation from any cloud-based POS (Shopify, Square, Clover etc.)
and the involved merchants this system could be implemented at scale. Alernatively, for non-cloud POS providers, network porting could potentially be an option for accessing transaction data.
